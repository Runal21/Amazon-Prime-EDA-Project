Understanding audience preferences, content trends, and platform performance is crucial for sustaining user engagement and increasing subscriptions. This project aims to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Amazon Prime's dataset, which includes TV shows and movies. The goal is to extract insights about content distribution, genre popularity, key contributors, and trends over time, which can help in **strategic decision-making** regarding content acquisition and recommendations.  \n","\n","**Dataset Overview**  \n","The dataset consists of two main files:  \n","- **titles.csv** – Contains metadata about movies and TV shows, including **title, genre, release year, IMDB ratings, and runtime.**  \n","- **credits.csv** – Provides details about the **cast and crew**, including actors, directors, and their roles.  \n","\n","By analyzing this data, we can gain valuable insights into **content trends, most popular genres, audience preferences, and key contributors** driving Amazon Prime’s success.  \n","\n","**Objectives of the EDA**\n","\n","The primary objectives of this analysis include:  \n","1. **Content Distribution Analysis**:\n","   - Determine the **proportion of movies vs. TV shows** available on Amazon Prime.  \n","   - Analyze the **release year trends** to see if Amazon is focusing more on recent content or older classics.\n","\n","2. **Genre Popularity & Trends**:\n","   - Identify the **most popular genres** and how they vary over time.  \n","   - Determine which genres dominate the **movie vs. TV show** categories.  \n","\n","3. **Key Contributors (Actors & Directors)**:  \n","   - Analyze the most **frequently featured actors and directors**.  \n","   - Determine whether **certain actors or directors** are more associated with high-rated content.  \n","\n","4. **Content Ratings & Audience Preferences**:  \n","   - Examine the **distribution of IMDb ratings** across different genres and content types.  \n","   - Identify if higher-rated content belongs to specific **genres or directors**.  \n","\n","5. **Missing Data & Data Cleaning**:  \n","   - Detect and handle **missing values and duplicate entries** to ensure data reliability.  \n","   - Standardize categorical fields like **genre, country, and language** for consistency.  \n","\n","**Insights and Business Impact**\n","\n","**1. Content Strategy Optimization**  \n","Understanding **what type of content performs well** can help Amazon Prime **invest in trending genres** and **license popular shows/movies** that align with audience preferences. If data shows that **action and thriller movies are more popular than drama or romance**, Amazon can allocate more resources to acquiring or producing such content.  \n","\n","**2. Audience Engagement & Retention**  \n","By analyzing **IMDb ratings and user preferences**, Amazon Prime can refine its **recommendation algorithms**, ensuring users are suggested content they are most likely to enjoy. If the dataset indicates that users highly rate content from **specific directors or actors**, those contributors can be prioritized in future licensing deals.  \n","\n","**3. Market Expansion Opportunities**  \n","If the analysis shows that **a particular genre is gaining traction in certain regions**, Amazon Prime can focus on **regional content production** to attract a **wider global audience**.  \n","\n","**4.
